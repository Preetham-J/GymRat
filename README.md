# GymRat
GymRat was a project created for Hack the North 2018.

## The Problem
The problem we tried to tackle is the lack of virtual personal training assistants. Personal trainers can be expensive or hard to schedule around. Additionally, new weight lifters or people new to fitness in general might feel pressured by personal trainers and might prefer to work out alone. Unfortunately, it is extremely easy to seriously injure yourself during workouts from bad form. We seeked to solve this problem at Hack the North 2018.

## Our Solution
Using TensorFlow.js and PoseNet, a pose estimation machine learning model, we have designed a web application that provides a fast and accurate personal training service. Users can simply upload a photo, and our app will analyse the photo and provide feedback to the user to allow them to perfect their form.

## Future Goals
As of now, the application is limited in various ways. Starting off, only photos can be submitted for analysis, but we would like to add the ability to analyse videos as well. Secondly, only barbell squats are covered in our analysis, but we would like to add many other exercises as well. Through these additions, GymRat would be a fully fledged personal trainer applicaiton.

## Skills Learned
From using a machine learning model to web application development, there were a lot of things learned throughout the development of this project for each member of the group. It was great to be able to explore computer vision and machine learning within a fitness based project. All in all, it was a very fun and very informative!
